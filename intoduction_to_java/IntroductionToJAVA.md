<h1>ðŸ§  What is Java?</h1>

Java is a powerful, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is widely used for building desktop, web, and mobile applications.
Java is known for its portability â€” the ability to run the same code on any platform that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
